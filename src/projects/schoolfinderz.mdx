## Introduction

SchoolFinderz was a project aimed at helping parents find the right secondary schools, junior colleges, and universities for their children.

We wanted to go beyond a simple list of schools - the app included:

- Interactive Google Maps with school locations

- Sentiment analysis from school reviews

- A chatbot for parent queries

- CCA (Co-Curricular Activities) filtering

- Advanced search and recommendation features

I was primarily responsible for integrating the Google Maps API and making sure the locations displayed correctly and interactively on the frontend.

## My Role: Google Maps API Integration

The Maps integration itself went smoothly:

- Displaying 500+ school locations

- Markers with tooltips and detailed info

- Interactive zoom and panning

- Dynamic filtering based on user input

- Route tracking

Technically, it was solid. But the project taught me one of the harshest lessons in API usage and cost management.

## The $500 Mistake

I underestimated how expensive API calls could get.

Here’s what happened:

- **I did not realize that budget alerts do not stop API usage — they only notify you.**

- **My code was inefficient: every page refresh triggered 500+ geocoding API calls, one for each school location.**

Within two days, I racked up over $500 SGD in Google Maps charges.

It was a painful, expensive lesson in:

- Efficient API usage

- Rate limiting

- Optimizing data caching

- Cost-awareness in cloud platforms

## Lessons Learned

Despite the financial pain, I learned a lot:

- Code efficiency matters in real-world applications — every API call can cost money

- Caching is very important - storing geocoded results avoids repeated calls

- Collaboration is essential - I studied teammates’ design patterns and workflows

- Cloud platforms are powerful but tricky - Google Cloud Platform UI is unintuitive and slow to navigate

From this, I became much more deliberate with:

- Backend optimizations

- API call batching

- Planning and reviewing cloud costs

## Other Features of the App

While I focused on Maps, the team also implemented:

- Sentiment analysis on reviews to gauge school reputation

- A chatbot to answer parent questions

- Advanced filters for CCAs and school type

Intuitive UI for browsing school data

- The project gave me exposure to a full-stack application, combining frontend interactivity, backend logic, and external API integrations.
