## Introduction

BetterReadME was a personal project born out of curiosity and a desire to make creating README files easier, with multi-language support, all from the command line.

I wanted a lightweight tool that allowed developers to generate structured README files in any language without leaving the terminal.

---

## Goals & Vision

- Create README files quickly using a CLI interface

- Support multiple languages

- Provide a REPL-style workflow for continuous editing and translation

- Keep everything offline, without requiring cloud-based APIs

---

## Implementation

Language Translation: Used Argos Translate to convert README content into different languages.

CLI Interface: REPL loop allowing users to:

- Input section headings

- Add content dynamically

- Translate sections

- Offline Workflow: Designed to operate entirely on the user’s device without an internet connection

---

## Why It Was Discontinued

Despite my initial enthusiasm, I quickly ran into real-world limitations:

**Offline translation is storage-heavy**

- Argos Translate relies on language models stored locally

- Multi-language support would require dozens of megabytes per language

Uploading these large files to GitHub is infeasible

**Economic feasibility**

- Passing the storage burden to users is unreasonable

- Most translation tools are cloud/server-based for a reason

Eventually, I realized: offline translation for multiple languages on a CLI is not practical without a dedicated server.

So I discontinued the project - but it was an excellent learning experience.

## Lessons Learned

BetterReadME taught me more than just CLI programming:

- How to build a REPL loop in Python

- How to structure a command-line workflow for usability

- The practical limitations of offline machine learning models

- That cloud or server-based translation exists for a reason

- How to plan a project’s feasibility before implementation

It was humbling - I went in thinking it was a tiny project, but it revealed the realities of storage constraints, user experience, and model size.

Sometimes, the lessons from failure are more valuable than the success itself. This project is one of those lessons.
